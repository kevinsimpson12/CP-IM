The CP-IM is a general stochastic model for spatial spread and (bi-stable) cell-state differentiation. 
The model is an hybrid model mixing the Contact Process (CP), modelling bacterial colony growth on hard agar and 
the Ising Model (IM) modeling cell diffentiation and cell-cell interactions. 

To model de CP, the code from the following repository is used:

To implement the Random Number Generator (RNG) the following repository was use:
